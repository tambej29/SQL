## A. Customer Journey
### Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the `subscriptions` table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

### Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

## B. Data Analysis Questions
1. ### How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

2. ### What is the monthly distribution of `trial` plan `start_date` values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value.
```sql
SELECT
  MONTHNAME(start_date) AS month,
  COUNT(customer_id) AS monthly_distribution
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 0
GROUP  BY month
ORDER BY monthly_distribution DESC;
```

			 ELSE '1 + year' END AS time
	FROM subscriptions AS a
	JOIN subscriptions AS b USING(customer_id)
	WHERE b.plan_id= 3 AND a.plan_id = 0

FROM subscriptions AS a
JOIN subscriptions AS b ON a.customer_id = b.customer_id
    AND b.start_date < a.start_date
WHERE YEAR(a.start_date) = 2020
    AND YEAR(b.start_date) = 2020
    AND a.plan_id = 1 AND b.plan_id = 2;
```
| downgraded_customers |
|----------------------|

### C. Challenge Payment Question
<details>
<summary>
View details:
</summary>
  
The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new `payments` table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the `subscriptions` table with the following requirements:

  - monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
  - upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
  - upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
  - once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

Example outputs for this table might look like the following:
