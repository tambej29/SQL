## A. Customer Journey
### Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the `subscriptions` table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

### Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

## B. Data Analysis Questions
1. ### How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS num_cust
FROM subscriptions;
```
| num_cust |
|----------|
| 1000     |

- _Foodie-Fi had 1000 customers_

2. ### What is the monthly distribution of `trial` plan `start_date` values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value.
```sql
SELECT
  MONTHNAME(start_date) AS month,
  COUNT(customer_id) AS monthly_distribution
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 0
GROUP  BY month
ORDER BY monthly_distribution DESC;
```
| month     | monthly_distribution |
|-----------|----------------------|
| March     | 94                   |
| July      | 89                   |
| August    | 88                   |
| January   | 88                   |

| November  | 75                   |
| February  | 68                   |
- _March had the highest number of trials, while February had the lowest._

3. ### What plan `start_date` values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each `plan_name`.
```sql
SELECT
	plan_name,
  COUNT(plan_id) AS event_count
FROM subscriptions
JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) > 2020
GROUP  BY plan_name;
```
| plan_name     | event_count |
|---------------|-------------|
| churn         | 71          |
| pro monthly   | 60          |
| pro annual    | 63          |
| basic monthly | 8           |
- _Most customers canceled their subscriptions after 2020._

4. ### What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
```sql
SELECT
	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count,
  ROUND((SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) * 100 FROM subscriptions WHERE plan_id = 4) /
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id), 1) AS churn_rate
FROM subscriptions;
```
| customer_count | churn_rate |
|----------------|------------|
| 1000           | 30.7       |
- _Approximately 30% of Foodie-Fi customers have churned._

5. ### How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?
```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as customer_count,
    COUNT(churn) as churn_count,
    ROUND(COUNT(churn) * 100 / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions)) as churn_rate
FROM(
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        plan_name,
        CASE WHEN plan_name = 'trial' AND LEAD(plan_name) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY plan_id) = 'churn' THEN 'churn'
            ELSE NULL END as churn
    FROM subscriptions
    JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
    ) as sbqry;
```
| customer_count | churn_count | churn_rate |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| 1000           | 92          | 9          |

6. ### What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?
```sql
SELECT
	plan_name,
	COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count,
  ROUND(COUNT(customer_id) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions) * 100, 2) AS plan_after_trial_percent
FROM
	(SELECT
    customer_id,
    plan_name,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id) as rn
	FROM subscriptions as s
  JOIN plans as p using(plan_id)
    ) AS t
WHERE t.rn = 2
GROUP BY plan_name;
```
| plan_name     | customer_count | plan_after_trial_percent |
|---------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| basic monthly | 546            | 54.60                    |

8. ### What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 `plan_name` values at `2020-12-31`?
9. ### How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?
10. ### How many days on average does it take for a customer to upgrade from an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?

12. ### How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?
