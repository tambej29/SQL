Focus Areas

Subscriber Growth and Trends:

How has the userbase grown over time (focus on the join dates)? Are there any seasonal patterns?
Where are most subscribers located geographically? Are there emerging markets to target?
Subscription Plan Analysis

What's the distribution of users across subscription tiers (Basic, Standard, Premium)?
Are there correlations between plan choice, location, and device type?
Revenue Drivers

How much revenue does the average subscriber from each plan and country generate?
Are there any high-value customer segments?
User Churn

Analyze the 'Account Status' and 'Last Payment Date' to calculate churn rate.
Are any early indicators of churn detectable (like patterns in device usage or join date)?
Device Preferences

What are the most popular devices for streaming?
Does this vary depending on subscription plan or geographical location?
Technical Approach

Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the dataset using a tool like Python (Pandas library) or a spreadsheet program. Check for missing values, inconsistencies, and potential formatting errors.

Descriptive Statistics: Calculate summaries like mean, median, and standard deviation for revenue, join dates, and other relevant variables. This will give you a baseline understanding of the data.

Data Visualization:

Create bar charts to visualize the distribution of subscription plans and device types.
Plot line charts to show subscriber growth trends over time.
Consider heatmaps or maps if exploring geographical distribution is key.
Manager's Tip:  Don't just analyze the data, tell a story with it. Link your insights back to potential business actions:

Growth Strategy: Could Netflix target promotions or content towards specific regions or demographics?
Pricing Strategy: Is there potential to optimize the pricing of different subscription tiers?
Churn Prevention: Can Netflix implement proactive measures to reduce churn based on your findings?
