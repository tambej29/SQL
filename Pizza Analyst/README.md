# üçïPizza Sales Analysis

## Project Objective:
The objective of this analysis is to comprehensively analyze the pizza sales dataset using SQL to identify the driving factors behind sales, the busiest hour of the day, the day of the week with the highest order volume, and the month with the highest sales. Tableau will be used to design an interactive dashboard to visualize the insights.

## Project Scope:

- Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) for pizza sales analysis.
- Analyze which pizza categories and sizes generate the highest sales.
- Conduct trend analysis by hour, day, and month to identify patterns and seasonality in pizza sales.
- Identify the best- and worst-performing pizzas based on sales and other relevant metrics.
